# Three-phase half-bridge inverter
5V downscales three-phased inverter based on STM32 Microcontrollers.

## Project
Since many students at Aarhus University (AU) don't have accees to larger inverter for control, a downscaled model is made to accommodate this need.
Here both the low voltages and currents makes it relatively inexpensive, easy to get ahold of and safe to use, it performs as a good platform for learning.
Even if grid impedances does not scale, control algorithems, stability and many other advanced conecpt can be tested.

This project is manly devoloped under [Associate Professor Uffe Jakobsen](https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/uja%40ece.au.dk) for his classes and research into inverter control.
